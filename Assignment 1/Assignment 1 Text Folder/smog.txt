The thick Smog blankets the City like a poisonous Shroud, turning the Sunlight into a sickly orange Haze. Residents hurry through the murky Streets wearing protective Masks, while tall Buildings fade into the toxic Atmosphere above. The dangerous mix of Pollutants and Chemicals comes primarily from Vehicle Emissions and Factory Smoke, creating a persistent Dome of contaminated Air that traps both Heat and harmful Particles. Local Authorities often issue urgent Warnings when the Smog reaches dangerous Levels, advising vulnerable Populations, especially Children and the Elderly, to remain indoors until the Quality of Air improves.
